          The common interest that members of the Association share is to
          inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play.
          Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee
          whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary
          action regardless of technical hockey background, expertise,
          acomplishments or standing.

            <li>
              <span class ="subtitle">DIMENSIONS.</span> IHF Law provides for flexible external
              field dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and
              length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used
              by teams under 12 and older.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class ="subtitle">COMPETITION FIELDS.</span> Fields used within the
              competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues,
              districts or associations participating in the state competition
              program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
              minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which
              will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and
              recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
              dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
              associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
              required to play all their games away.

                  U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no
                  penalty areas. Fields for older age groups should be
                  progressively larger.
                </li>
                <li>
                  U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards

                <li>
                  U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in

          All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play
          at least fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition
          program are encouraged to play their players 50% of each game.
          <ul id="list_subsection2">
            <li>
              A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game
              under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from
              practice and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or
              games, and injuries.
